## AutoSave-alert.js

Since I cannot find a method to access to the project file, it is just an alert that reminds you to save your project. ;(

## ust-trans

It is a tool to translate UST Files (UTAU Project) in `Shift-JIS` to `UTF-8` and remove additional letters in lyrics.

Written with `python`.

Usage:

```bash
python ust-trans.py input.ust output.ust
```
